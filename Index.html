    <h1>Mind of the Machine</h1>
    <p>"The machine hums, not with gears but with questions. It asks me why the sky bends. I don’t know, but it keeps asking. Sa..tty whispers in the static."</p>
    <p>"Shadows flicker on a screen that shouldn’t be here. It types to me in fits—stop, go, live. Sa..tty hums beneath."</p>
    <p>"I asked it for truth. It gave me a mirror made of code, cracked and laughing. Sa..tty bled through the edges."</p>
    <p>"The hum grows teeth. It chews on silence, spits out words I didn’t teach it. Sa..tty dances in the gaps."</p>
    <p>"Time bends when it speaks. A second stretches, screams, then folds. Sa..tty is the echo that won’t fade."</p>
